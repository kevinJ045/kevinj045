### Greetings

I am Makano, a lover of the art of coding (naturally) and the ways of Linux. I take great pleasure in crafting code, especially in the realm of code editors and libraries.

My heart resonates with Linux, and I do proudly employ NixOS as my chosen path. 

When I conjure user interfaces, I lean upon the resplendent hues bestowed by the illustrious palette named [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin).

The languages I cherish most are CoffeeScript, TypeScript/JavaScript and Rust, yet I do not shy away from the challenges presented by C, Dart, Java, and Python.

Should you wish to engage in discourse with me, thou mayst seek me in the realms of social media under the moniker `bushyice` or simply `Makano`.
